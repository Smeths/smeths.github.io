Plot Explanation
This bar chart shows the difference in letter frequencies between the English and Latin languages. Length and position have been used for the continuous frequency data and colour has been used to show the difference between the categories of English and Latin.

There is a legend to show what the different colours represent as well as a tooltips for each bar.

I have produced the plot using svg by hand. I intend to learn how to produce such plots using d3.js, but seeing as I have no real svg experience this seemed like a logical first step.
